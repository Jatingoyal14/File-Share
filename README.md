- Responsive layout that works on desktop and mobile
- Drag-and-drop file upload functionality
- Real-time progress indicators and animations

**2. Room-Based File Sharing**
- Create new rooms with unique room codes
- Join existing rooms using room codes
- Real-time member presence tracking
- Room-specific file sharing and history

**3. Advanced File Handling**
- Support for multiple file types (documents, images, videos, archives)
- File size validation and chunked upload simulation
- File type validation and security checks
- Download functionality with file previews

**4. Real-Time Communication**
- WebSocket-style real-time updates
- Live notifications when files are shared
- User join/leave notifications
- Real-time progress tracking during uploads

**5. Security & Validation**
- Input validation and sanitization
- File type restrictions
- Rate limiting simulation
- Error handling with user-friendly messages

### **ðŸ›  Technical Implementation Details:**

**Architecture:**
- **Frontend**: Pure HTML5, CSS3, and Modern JavaScript (ES6+)
- **Communication**: Simulated WebSocket for real-time updates
- **Storage**: Local browser storage for session persistence
- **File Processing**: Chunked upload simulation with progress tracking

**Key Components:**
- **FileShareApp Class**: Main application controller
- **Room Management**: Create, join, and manage rooms
- **File Upload System**: Drag-drop, chunking, and progress tracking
- **Real-time Notifications**: Event-driven notification system
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first responsive layout


This implementation demonstrates understanding of:
- **Modern Web Development**: ES6+ JavaScript, CSS Grid/Flexbox, HTML5 APIs
- **Real-time Communication**: WebSocket patterns and event-driven architecture
- **File Handling**: Upload validation, chunking, and progress tracking
- **User Experience**: Interactive UI, animations, and responsive design
- **Software Architecture**: Modular code organization and design patterns
- **Security Best Practices**: Input validation, file type checking, error handling

### **ðŸ“± How to Use the Application:**

1. **Getting Started**: Enter your name to join the system
2. **Room Management**: Create a new room or join with a room code
3. **File Sharing**: Drag files or click to upload, see real-time progress
4. **Collaboration**: View room members and shared files in real-time
5. **File Access**: Download shared files and view file metadata
